Description:  
This RPA will go to https://mops.twse.com.tw/mops/web/index and search for specific companies.  
It will capture the condense financial report and paste to a xlsx file and delete all columns except EPS and Book Value per Share.  
After capturing all stocks, the RPA will generate the line chart about EPS and Book Value per Share of the company, saving the file named of the capture date.  

In theory, You can capture as many companies as possible. I choose 3 companies for demo purpose.
